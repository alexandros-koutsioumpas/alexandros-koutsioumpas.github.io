It is a pleasure to invite students interested in Biophysics of biological membranes and neutron scattering to the SINE2020 supported school that I organise together with Dr. Chris Garvey this summer in Garching (near Munich), with the title "Neutrons for membrane biophysics". Registration will be open in the start of April through this [web site](http://www.fz-juelich.de/jcns/SINE2020)

Topics that will be covered include small angle scattering, neutron reflectometry, GISANS, lamellar diffraction, molecular deuteration and molecular dynamics in relation to model biomembrane systems.
