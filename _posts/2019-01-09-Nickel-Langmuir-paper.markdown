Topics that will be covered include small angle scattering, neutron reflectometry, GISANS, A team lead by scientists at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Munich, performed neutron reflectivity measurements at MARIA and REFSANS instruments, that shed light at the interfacial adhesion layer between living cells and hydrophilic surfaces. The related work was recently published at the [Langmuir journal](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b02228).
