Together with Dr. Olaf Holderer, Dr. Chris Garvey and Prof. Tommy Nylander, we have co-edited a collection of articles in _Frontiers in Chemistry and Physics_ under the topic title [_Membrane Structure and Dynamics Studied with Neutron Scattering_](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/13879/membrane-structure-and-dynamics-studied-with-neutron-scattering). 

In this collection you will also find the [first article](https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2021.631277) that uses the newly developed package [anaklasis](https://github.com/alexandros-koutsioumpas/anaklasis) for the fit of neutron reflectivity datasets from a quite elaborate lipid membrane system.
