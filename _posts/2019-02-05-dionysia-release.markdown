A new open access paper published at the Journal of Applied Crystallography ([link](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576719003534)) describes an integrated indirect Fourier transform/simulated annealing method that exploits the information content of multiple solvent contrast neutron reflectivity data, that permits the model-independent recovery of interfacial structure at the air/liquid and solid/liquid interface.

The related software ([dionysia]((https://doi.org//10.1107/S1600576719003534/kc5089sup1.zip))) requires as input experimental neutron reflectivity curves and the basic parameters of the experiment (like the scattering length density substrate and solvent), while providing as output, the scattering length density and hydration (solvent volume fraction)  profiles at the interface, without the need for any additional information.

Feedback and comments for future improvements from potential users will be appreciated!
