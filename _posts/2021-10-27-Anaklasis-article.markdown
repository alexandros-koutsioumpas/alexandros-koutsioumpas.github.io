After the release of the open-source package [_anaklasis_](https://github.com/alexandros-koutsioumpas/anaklasis) for model-based refinements of x-ray and neutron reflectivity data sets, I am happy to announce that the [article](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S1600576721009262) describing the used methods is published in open access format in the Journal of Applied Crystallography. 

In the coming months, the package repository will be populated with more examples of data refinements and also an effort will be made to make the error messages even more comprehensive. In the meantime any feedback and suggestions about the evolution of the package is always welcome.
