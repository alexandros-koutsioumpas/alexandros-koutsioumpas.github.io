It is a pleasure to be a member of the scientific commitee of the upcoming ESS-BESS workshop that will take place in Lund this summer. It will be a great forum for people working in the field of membrane biophysics.

Registration and abstract submssion details will be availiable soon. Keep an eye on the workshop's [website](https://www.linxs.se/events/2022/6/13/linxs-partner-event-lipid-bilayers-at-ess-bess-in-lund-13-15-june-2022).
