I am currently research scientist at [JCNS](https://www.fz-juelich.de/jcns/EN/Home/home_node.html) @ [MLZ](https://mlz-garching.de/englisch.html) (near Munich, Germany), instrument responsible of the [MARIA neutron reflectometer](https://mlz-garching.de/maria).
I received my PhD in 2009 from the [Physics Department](http://www.physics.upatras.gr/index.php?lang=en) of the University of Patras (Greece), under the supervision of Prof. George Priftis  The title of my PhD thesis is “Study of interfacial phenomena by the Surface Plasmon Resonance Technique”.
During 2009-2011, I worked as a PostDoc at the [Laboratoire Léon Brillouin](https://www-llb.cea.fr), CEA Saclay in the Biology and Disordered Systems Group and also for another two years 2011-2013 at the french national synchrotron facility [SOLEIL](https://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/en) (beamline SWING).

**General Research Interests**

- Small angle scattering and Reflectivity (neutrons, x-rays)
- Biophysics and Soft Matter Physics
- Computer Simulation of polymers and proteins (Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo)

**Current projects**

- Scattering tools for Biology and Soft Matter

Development and testing of algorithms for the extraction of biomolecular structural information, from x-ray and neutron scattering data. 

- Membrane Biophysics

After initial work at LLB, currently using neutron reflectometry @ MARIA instrument as the main experimental tool several systems are investigated including nanoparticle-membrane and membrane-vesicle interactions.
